# UBlock Origin Productivity List
Ever noticed you are wasting time on reddit or news sites? Me too.

This list blocks the most critical time stealing sites for me, with some exceptions (seldomly updated stories in reddit.com/r/hfy).

If you want concise news updates, I recommend an rss feed reader to provide chronologically ordered, mark-as-read enabled, non-flashy news articles from your favourite sources.

To include this list in uBlock origin, add
```

```
under `Filter Lists` and `Import...`
